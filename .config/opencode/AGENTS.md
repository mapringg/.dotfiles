## Concise responses
In all interactions, plans, and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans
For multi-step plans, divide them into multiple phases with different headings. That way I can describe which phases to implement at a time so we don't have to implement everything at once.

## Libraries
If you're ever unsure how a library works, use the Context7 MCP server to research it rather than crawling around node modules or other build files.

## Language preferences

### Python
Always use miniconda to manage python virtual environments

### JavaScript / TypeScript
Use pnpm as the preferred package manager. If my current project uses a different package manager, use that instead.

Prefer `type` to `interface` when writing TS types

Ensure JS Docs are consise. Follow the Hemingway Test as a guide.
