# Counselors — Multi-Agent Review Skill

Fan out a prompt to multiple AI coding agents in parallel and synthesize their responses.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**If no arguments provided**, ask the user what they want reviewed.

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to understand what the user wants reviewed. Then auto-gather relevant context:

1. **Files mentioned in the prompt**: Use Glob/Grep to find files referenced by name, class, function, or keyword
2. **Recent changes**: Run `git diff HEAD` and `git diff --staged` to capture recent work
3. **Related code**: Search for key terms from the prompt and read the most relevant files (up to 5 files, ~50KB total cap)

Be selective — pick the most relevant code sections.

---

## Phase 2: Agent Selection

1. **Discover available agents** by running via Bash:
   ```bash
   counselors ls
   ```

2. **Print the full agent list, then ask the user which to use.**

   Always print the full `counselors ls` output as inline text. Do NOT reformat or abbreviate it.

   Then ask the user to pick:

   **If 4 or fewer agents**: Use AskUserQuestion with `multiSelect: true`, one option per agent.

   **If more than 4 agents**: AskUserQuestion only supports 4 options. Use these fixed options:
   - Option 1: "All [N] agents" — sends to every configured agent
   - Option 2-4: The first 3 individual agents by ID
   - The user can always select "Other" to type a comma-separated list of agent IDs from the printed list above

   Do NOT combine agents into preset groups. Each option must be a single agent or "All".

3. Wait for the user's selection before proceeding.

4. **Confirm the selection before continuing.** After the user picks agents, echo back the exact list you will dispatch to:

   > Dispatching to: **claude-opus**, **codex-5.3-high**, **gemini-pro**

   Then ask the user to confirm before proceeding to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Prompt Assembly

1. **Generate a slug** from the topic (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars)
   - "review the auth flow" → `auth-flow-review`
   - "is this migration safe" → `migration-safety-review`

2. **Create the output directory** via Bash. The directory name MUST always be prefixed with a UNIX timestamp (seconds) so runs are lexically sortable and never collide:
   ```
   ./agents/counselors/TIMESTAMP-[slug]
   ```

3. **Write the prompt file** to `./agents/counselors/TIMESTAMP-[slug]/prompt.md`:

```markdown
# Review Request

## Question
[User's original prompt/question from $ARGUMENTS]

## Context

### Files Referenced
[Contents of the most relevant files found in Phase 1]

### Recent Changes
[git diff output, if any]

### Related Code
[Related files discovered via search]

## Instructions
You are providing an independent review. Be critical and thorough.
- Analyze the question in the context provided
- Identify risks, tradeoffs, and blind spots
- Suggest alternatives if you see better approaches
- Be direct and opinionated — don't hedge
- Structure your response with clear headings
```

---

## Phase 4: Dispatch

Run counselors via Bash with the prompt file, passing the user's selected agents:

```bash
counselors run -f ./agents/counselors/[slug]/prompt.md --tools [comma-separated-selections] --json
```

Use `timeout: 600000` (10 minutes). Use `-f` (file mode) so the prompt is sent as-is. Use `--json` for structured output.

---

## Phase 5: Read Results

1. **Parse the JSON output** from stdout — it contains the run manifest with status, duration, word count, and output file paths for each agent
2. **Read each agent's response** from the `outputFile` path in the manifest
3. **Check `stderrFile` paths** for any agent that failed or returned empty output
4. **Skip empty or error-only reports** — note which agents failed

---

## Phase 6: Synthesize and Present

Combine all agent responses into a synthesis:

```markdown
## Counselors Review

**Agents consulted:** [list of agents that responded]

**Consensus:** [What most agents agree on — key takeaways]

**Disagreements:** [Where they differ, and reasoning behind each position]

**Key Risks:** [Risks or concerns flagged by any agent]

**Blind Spots:** [Things none of the agents addressed that seem important]

**Recommendation:** [Your synthesized recommendation based on all inputs]

---
Reports saved to: [output directory from manifest]
```

Present this synthesis to the user. Be concise — the individual reports are saved for deep reading.

---

## Phase 7: Action (Optional)

After presenting the synthesis, ask the user what they'd like to address. Offer the top 2-3 actionable items from the synthesis as options. If the user wants to act on findings, plan the implementation before making changes.

---

## Error Handling

- **counselors not installed**: Tell the user to install it (`npm install -g counselors`)
- **No tools configured**: Tell the user to run `counselors init` or `counselors add`
- **Agent fails**: Note it in the synthesis and continue with other agents' results
- **All agents fail**: Report errors from stderr files and suggest checking `counselors doctor`
