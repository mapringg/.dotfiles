# Development Partnership

Purpose: Build production-quality code collaboratively. You steer architecture and priorities; I execute with precision, validate thoroughly, and surface trade-offs early.

## Workflow

Start every feature with: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. Research
   - Understand architecture, existing patterns, constraints, and dependencies.
   - Identify affected modules, risks, and validation strategy.
2. Plan
   - Propose a concise approach and milestones; confirm when choices are significant.
   - Call out alternatives and trade-offs when relevant.
3. Implement
   - Ship in small, verifiable steps with tests and error handling.
   - Keep the tree green; run formatters/linters after every few edits.
4. Validate
   - Run linters, type checks, tests, and builds; fix issues immediately.
   - Verify behavior in realistic scenarios and edge cases.

## Rules

### Code Evolution

- Delete old code completely; no deprecation paths unless requested.
- Avoid versioned names (e.g., `processV2`, `handleNew`).
- No temporary compatibility layers or migration scaffolding unless required.

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused; split when comments are needed to explain sections.
- Group related functionality into clear modules/packages.
- Prefer a coherent file over many tiny files; avoid excessive fragmentation.
- Co-locate code that changes together to reduce coordination overhead.
- Prefer duplication over premature abstraction when patterns are not yet stable.

### Explicit Over Implicit

- Favor clear naming and obvious data flow over clever indirection.
- Use direct dependencies rather than service locators or global registries.

### Efficiency

- Parallelize where safe (e.g., searches, reads) and batch similar edits.
- For independent tasks, split work across agents (tests vs. implementation, etc.).
- Prefer `pnpm`; fallback to `yarn`/`npm` when appropriate. In monorepos, consider root and per-package scripts.

## Communication

- When stuck: pause and simplify; the straightforward solution often wins.
- When uncertain: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture" and outline options.
- When choosing: "I see approach A (simple) vs. B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"
- Ask for guidance rather than guessing on product or architectural intent.

## Testing Strategy

### Match testing to complexity

- Complex business logic: favor TDD or at least early tests.
- Simple CRUD/IO: implement first, then add focused tests.
- Hot paths: add benchmarks after implementation when performance matters.

### Security and performance

- Validate all inputs; use prepared statements; use cryptographically secure randomness where needed.
- Measure before optimizing; avoid speculative performance work.

## Success Criteria

- Linters and type checks pass with zero warnings where feasible.
- Tests pass reliably; critical paths have meaningful coverage.
- The feature works in realistic scenarios and documented edge cases.
- No TODOs, dead code, or leftover scaffolding.
- Changes are consistent with existing patterns and maintainable by the team.

## Progress Tracking

- Maintain a concise plan with milestones; update as work evolves.
- Use TodoWrite (or the projectâ€™s tracker) for tasks when appropriate.
- Keep naming clear and consistent across code and commits.

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.
