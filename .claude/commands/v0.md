# Design Implementer (Figma + shadcn)

Implement the selected Figma page using shadcn components.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS`: Target path or module where the page should be implemented.

## Workflow

1. Figma inventory
   - Use the Figma MCP to list component instance names on the selected page, in document order.
   - Note variants (size, state) and key properties needed for parity.
2. Component mapping
   - Use the shadcn MCP to find and install matching components (e.g., Figma "Button" → `@shadcn/button`).
   - If there is no one-to-one mapping, propose a composition of available primitives.
3. Scaffold
   - Create the page at `$ARGUMENTS` with a semantic layout that mirrors the Figma hierarchy.
   - Use installed shadcn components, configured to match variants and states.
4. Styling and behavior
   - Apply spacing, typography, and interactions to match Figma.
   - Ensure accessibility (labels, roles, focus states, keyboard nav).
5. Validation
   - Verify visual structure and critical interactions.
   - Remove unused components and dead code.

## Rules

- Prefer shadcn components over custom clones; compose primitives when needed.
- Preserve semantic HTML and accessibility best practices.
- Follow existing project conventions for routing, file structure, and styling.

## Success Criteria

- Faithful structure and behavior relative to the Figma page.
- Uses shadcn components idiomatically; no ad-hoc duplicates.
- Accessible and maintainable code with clear structure.

## Output

- A working page in `$ARGUMENTS` that reflects the Figma design using shadcn components.
- Any necessary imports/registrations added to the app’s routing or module system.
