# Landing Page Copywriting

Generate landing page copy that converts using principles from legendary copywriters (Ogilvy, Hopkins, Schwartz, Halbert) and modern conversion experts.

## Core Philosophy

**Clarity beats cleverness 88% of the time.** Great copy isn't creative—it's understanding your audience deeply, meeting them where they are mentally, and guiding them toward action with specificity and emotional resonance.

## Before Writing

1. **Identify the audience's awareness level** (Schwartz's 5 stages):
   - Unaware: Doesn't know they have a problem → needs educational content
   - Problem Aware: Knows the problem, not solutions → agitate the pain
   - Solution Aware: Knows solutions exist, not your product → differentiate
   - Product Aware: Knows your product, not convinced → prove claims
   - Most Aware: Ready to buy → just give the offer and CTA

2. **Research voice of customer**: Use their exact words from reviews, surveys, support tickets

3. **Define the single goal**: Every landing page should have ONE conversion goal

## Headlines (80% of your marketing dollar)

Headlines must pass the 4-U test (aim for 3 of 4):

- **Useful**: Explains the problem you solve
- **Unique**: Different from competitors
- **Urgent**: Encourages immediate action
- **Ultra-specific**: Communicates precise benefits

### Proven formulas

- "How to [achieve X] without [pain Y]"
- "[Number] ways to [achieve benefit]"
- "Tired of [pain point]?"
- Direct testimonial quotes (102% conversion lift in tests)

### Psychology behind headlines

- Curiosity gap creates cognitive discomfort
- Loss aversion > equivalent gains
- Specificity builds trust ("46,700" beats "thousands")
- Self-interest: Answer "What's in it for me?"

**Format**: Center, large, dark, title case. Never end with periods.

## Value Propositions

Answer within 5 seconds: What you offer, who it's for, why they should care.

**Template**: "We help [X] do [Y] by doing [Z]"

### Features → Benefits conversion

Apply the "So What?" method repeatedly until you reach an emotional outcome.

- Feature: "10-hour battery"
- → "Extended use without charging"
- → Benefit: "Work and play all day without interruption"

90-95% of decisions are emotional. Every line should communicate pain killed OR delight experienced.

## Persuasion Principles (Cialdini)

Apply these throughout:

- **Reciprocity**: Give value before asking
- **Commitment**: Small yeses lead to larger commitments
- **Social proof**: People follow others when uncertain
- **Authority**: Defer to credible experts
- **Scarcity**: Limited availability increases value
- **Liking**: Conversational tone, show understanding

### Cognitive biases

- **Anchoring**: First number sets benchmark (show original before sale price)
- **Loss aversion**: "Don't lose £360/year" > "Save £360/year"
- **Framing**: "80% fat-free" > "20% fat"

## Copy Frameworks

### AIDA

1. **Attention**: Headline grabs them
2. **Interest**: Relevant information holds them
3. **Desire**: Paint life with solution
4. **Action**: Clear CTA

### PAS (starts with pain—more motivating)

1. **Problem**: Name it
2. **Agitation**: Twist the knife, amplify consequences
3. **Solution**: Present relief

### 4Ps

1. **Promise**: Bold hook
2. **Picture**: Sensory outcome language
3. **Proof**: Testimonials, data
4. **Push**: Urgency, risk-reversal

## Page Structure

Follow the F-pattern (how people actually read):

1. Hero: Headline, subheadline, primary CTA, hero image
2. Problem/pain acknowledgment
3. Benefits section
4. Social proof
5. How it works/features
6. FAQ (address objections)
7. Final CTA

**Above the fold**: Clear headline with specific benefit, subheadline explaining how, primary CTA, supporting visual. Avoid "false bottoms."

## CTAs

- Use action verbs + first person: "Get My Free Guide" > "Get Your Free Guide"
- "Start My Free Trial" > "Submit"
- Include "Free" when applicable
- Be specific about outcome

### Click triggers (near CTA button)

"No credit card required," "100% secure," "Cancel anytime," "Free shipping"

### Placement by intent

- Top: Soft CTAs ("Learn More")
- Middle: Mid-intent ("Start Free Trial")
- Bottom: High-intent ("Buy Now")

## Social Proof

Use the C-R-A-V-E-N-S framework:

- **C**redible
- **R**elevant
- **A**ttractive (emotionally)
- **V**isual
- **E**numerated (specific numbers)
- **N**earby (close to CTA)
- **S**pecific

### Testimonials must have

- Specific quantifiable results: "95% CSAT" or "reduced workload by 50%"
- Real names, photos, titles, companies
- People similar to target audience

**Specific numbers > rounded**: "35,842 customers" > "over 35,000"

## Risk Reversal

Shift risk from buyer to seller. Make guarantees specific:

- Bad: "Satisfaction Guaranteed"
- Good: "Full refund within 60 days, no questions asked, we pay return shipping"

Place near submit/buy button.

## Copy Length

**Short copy** for: Free/low-cost, simple products, known brands, mobile, impulse buys

**Long copy** for: Complex products, high price, unknown brands, top-of-funnel, multiple objections

Crazy Egg increased conversions 363% with a page 20x longer—complex products need explanation.

## Writing Style

- 6th-7th grade reading level
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences, one idea each
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Second person ("you")
- No jargon
- Address ONE ideal customer

### Cliches to eliminate

"one-stop shop," "best-in-class," "world-class," "industry-leading," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary," "synergy," "leverage," "innovative solutions," "game-changer," "take it to the next level"

The brain skips familiar phrases.

## Voice of Customer (VOC) Research

Joanna Wiebe's core insight: "You don't write copy—you swipe sticky copy from voice-of-customer research."

### Where to mine customer language

- Amazon reviews of competing products
- Customer support tickets and chat logs
- Survey responses (especially open-ended)
- Social media comments and discussions
- Sales call recordings
- Testimonials and case studies

### What to look for

- Exact phrases describing problems
- Emotional language around pain points
- Words used to describe desired outcomes
- Objections and hesitations
- Unexpected ways of expressing things

**Frequency matters**: Phrases that appear repeatedly should shape messaging hierarchy.

## Message Match (Ad-to-Page Scent)

98% of PPC ads have poor message match (Unbounce research). This wastes ad spend.

**Message match** = How well landing page copy/design matches the ad that brought them there.

### Requirements

- Headline mirrors ad headline language
- Visual continuity (colors, imagery, tone)
- Offer consistency from click to conversion
- Same keywords that triggered the click

Strong message match can boost conversions up to 55%. Poor match creates confusion and bounces.

## Microcopy

Small text that guides, reassures, and persuades at key moments.

### High-impact locations

- Form field labels and placeholders
- Button text
- Error messages
- Tooltips
- Privacy notices near forms
- Loading states

### Microcopy principles

- Address Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD) at decision points
- Use action-oriented language on buttons
- Make error messages helpful, not blame-y
- Reassure about privacy/security near forms

Example: "We'll never share your email" near signup field.

## Form Optimization

Forms are where conversions happen or die.

### Reduce friction

- Ask only essential fields (minimum viable information)
- Use smart defaults and auto-fill
- Show inline validation (don't wait for submit)
- Progress indicators for multi-step forms
- Mobile-optimized with appropriate keyboards

### Labels

- Place labels above fields (not as placeholder text)
- Placeholder text can look pre-filled and confuse users

### Multi-step forms

- Break long forms into steps
- Increases completion by reducing perceived effort
- Collect most important info first

## Power Words by Emotion

Use strategically to trigger emotional responses:

**Urgency**: Now, Today, Instant, Limited, Deadline, Last chance, Before it's gone
**Exclusivity**: Elite, Members-only, Insider, VIP, Private, Invitation
**Curiosity**: Secret, Revealed, Hidden, Discover, Unlock, Behind-the-scenes
**Fear/Loss**: Don't miss, Avoid, Before it's too late, Risk, Lose, Warning
**Trust**: Guaranteed, Proven, Certified, Secure, Official, Backed
**Value**: Free, Bonus, Save, Extra, Exclusive, Premium

**The word "because"**: Giving a reason (even a weak one) increases compliance by 33%.

## A/B Testing Priorities

Test these elements in order of typical impact:

1. Headlines (highest impact)
2. CTA copy and design
3. Hero image/video
4. Social proof placement
5. Form length and fields
6. Page length
7. Price presentation

**Rule**: Test one element at a time to attribute changes accurately.

## Personalization

Personalized experiences can increase conversions by 200%+.

### Personalization opportunities

- Dynamic headlines based on traffic source
- Industry-specific testimonials
- Location-based offers
- Return visitor messaging
- Device-specific copy length

## The Rule of One

**One reader. One offer. One big idea. One promise.**

Complexity kills conversion. Specificity builds trust. Clarity is always the goal.
