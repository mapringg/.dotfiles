# Research Init From URL

Research URL for init guidelines.

## Instructions

Fetch a URL and determine which `/init-*` command it applies to, then offer to update or add guidelines based on the content.

If the URL is not already known from context, ask the user for the URL to fetch and analyze.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch the URL

1. Determine the URL from context or ask the user for it
   - If no URL provided, ask the user for one
   - Validate it looks like a URL (starts with http:// or https://)

2. Fetch the URL to retrieve the content
   - Prompt: "Extract the main content, focusing on best practices, guidelines, patterns, code examples, and recommendations. Summarize what this page is about and what technology/framework it covers."

3. If the fetch fails, report the error and ask for an alternative URL

---

## Phase 2: Identify the Init Command

Based on the fetched content, determine which init command this relates to.

**Detection strategy:**

1. **List available inits** dynamically:

   Scan `~/.claude/skills/faster/reference/init/helpers/init-*.md` to discover all available init commands. Extract each helper's name from the filename.

2. **Match content to an init**:
   - Analyze the fetched URL's domain and content keywords (framework names, imports, package names)
   - Match against the discovered init helper names
   - If multiple could match, pick the most specific one

3. **If no clear match**:
   - Ask user which init this should apply to
   - Or offer to create a new init command

---

## Phase 3: Compare with Existing Content

1. Read the matched init file: `~/.claude/skills/faster/reference/init/helpers/init-{name}.md`

2. Compare the fetched content against what we already have:
   - **Already covered**: Topics/rules we already address
   - **New content**: Guidelines, patterns, or examples not in our init
   - **Conflicts**: Anything that contradicts our current advice

3. **Extract actionable additions**:
   - Code examples (prioritize these!)
   - Rules or guidelines
   - Common mistakes/pitfalls
   - Performance tips
   - TypeScript patterns

---

## Phase 4: Present Findings

Show the user:

```
## URL Analysis: {url}

**Detected framework**: {Name}
**Matched init**: `/init-{name}`

### Already Covered
- [things we already have]

### New Content Found
1. **{Topic}**
   - Description of the guideline
   ```typescript
   // Code example if available
   ```

2. **{Topic}**
   ...

### Conflicts with Current Init

- [any contradictions, if present]

```

---

## Phase 5: Offer to Update

Ask the user:

```

Would you like me to:

1. Add all new content to `/init-{name}`
2. Add selected items only (I'll ask which ones)
3. Skip — just keep this as research

```

If user chooses to update:
1. Integrate the new content into the init file
2. Format according to init conventions (see [add.md](add.md) for template)
3. Preserve existing content structure
4. Report what was added

---

## Content Integration Guidelines

When adding content from the URL:

1. **Prioritize code examples** — extract and format them properly
2. **Match the style** of existing init content
3. **Place appropriately**:
   - Rules go in "Rules" or relevant subsection
   - Code examples near related rules
   - Mistakes in "Common Mistakes" section
4. **Keep it concise** — don't copy entire articles, extract key points
5. **Cite the source** — add a comment with the URL
